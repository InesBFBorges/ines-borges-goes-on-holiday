  <div id="past-year-summarize">
  <p>This last year has been awesome!</p>
  <p>Full of challenges and new learnings both professionally and personally.</p>
  <p>It has been a pleasure to grow with my company Core Soluções. They are very motivated and spread that feeling.</p>
  <p>Seeing projects delivered to the client has given me great satisfaction and an even bigger sense of accomplishment.</p>
  <p>The struggle is hard when the lazyness settles in and even harder when there are feelings of depression but the teamwork, the sympathy and the will to go on and achieve something has always helped me through the bad times.</p>
  <p>I hope next year will be as good or better than this year.</p>
  <p>With that being said...</p>
  <p>Farewell my friend</p>
