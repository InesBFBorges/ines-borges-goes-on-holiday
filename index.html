  <p>This last year has been awesome!</p>
  <p>Full of challenges and new learnings both professionally and personally.</p>
  <p>It is a pleasure to be part of Continental Mabor.</p>
  <p>Seeing projects delivered to the client has given me great satisfaction and an even bigger sense of accomplishment.</p>
  <p>Being part of this team means being part of something important and meaningful.</p>
  <p>I hope next year will be as good or better than this year.</p>
  <p>With that being said...</p>
  <p>Farewell my friend</p>
